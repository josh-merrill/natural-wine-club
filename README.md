# Natural Wine Club

## About this project

Welcome to Natural Wine Club. This is a small React-based application developed as a portfolio project to showcase my skills in web development. The website allows users to explore and purchase a curated selection of natural wines, and go through a simulated checkout process when they're ready to make a purchase.
